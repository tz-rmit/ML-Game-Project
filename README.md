## Credit for Super Polyspawn Wars

The starter code for part 2 has been taken from this public repo: [https://github.com/josephtkim/super-polyspawn-wars](https://github.com/josephtkim/super-polyspawn-wars)

It has been modified slightly to facilitate ML-Agents and to increase the difficulty level.

## Loading Scenes and Models for Super Polyspawn Wars

The training scenes for control scheme 1 and control scheme 2 are located at Assets/Scenes, as SuperPolyspawnWars and SuperPolyspawnWars 1, respectively.
The best trained models can be found in Assets/SavedModels, and are named according to their contorol scheme

## Mandatory: Student contributions
TODO: Please summarise each team member's contributions here. Include both an approximate, percentage-based breakdown (e.g., "Anna: 50%, Tom: 50%") **and a high-level summary of what each member worked on, in dot-point form**.

Ideally, any disputes reagarding the contributions should be resolved prior to submission, but if there is an unresolved dispute then please indicate that this is the case. Do not override each other's contribution statements -- this will be penalised regardless of who is in the right!
